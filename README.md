# Employee-Payroll







UseCase1-Create a Employee Payroll Spring
Project to cater to REST Request from
Employee Payroll UI - Here we will reuse the Employee Payroll Frontend UI
we have already developed
- Instead of making REST call to JSONServer will now
make server calls to Employee Payroll Spring App
- Also test the REST API using CURL Commandsista 

















USeCase2-Create a Rest Controller to
demonstrate the various HTTP Methods
- Before starting set application.properties to set
properties of MySQL Driver and MySQL Credentials
- Test the REST Calls using CURL.
- At this stage the interest is to establish the
connectivity and ensure data is transmitted in REST
Calls








UseCase 3-Introducing DTO and Model to
Employee Payroll App - Note that we have kept the DTO and Model fairly
simplistic with only Name and Salary
- This is because we are still in the setup of the
Layers and once set we would make Employee
Payroll as full -fledged Object for Front End to make REST Call.
- Currently we will do CURL Call to ensure











UseCase 4-Introducing Services Layer in
Employee Payroll App - Note that Controller in UC1 was creating the
Model and returning the Model on the REST Calls.
This is the job of services layer to manage the
Model.
- Autowired Annotation will be used to do
Dependency Injection of the Services Object to
the Controller.












UseCase 5-Ability for the Services Layer to
store the Employee Payroll Data
- Note that Services Layer is not storing, updating
or deleting Employee Payroll Data in UC 2.
- In this use case the Services Layer will store this
Data in a Memory as a List. As we go further
down we will persist this data in DB.











UseCase6-Use Lombok Library to auto generate getters and setters for the DTO
- For Eclipse and IntelliJ Download Lombok Executable Jar and run the jar.
This will identify the IDE and install the add on 
- For VS Code Install Lombok 
- Add Lombok Dependency to POM File





















UseCase7-Use Lombok Library for
Logging 
- Note using Annotation @Slf4j at Class Level,
Logging is activated
- Note Logging Levels, Files and Patterns are
handled in application.properties
























UseCase8-Determine the Logging Levels, Logging
to Console or File, Logging Patterns, etc
based on this application running in
Dev, Staging or Production - Note we create application.properties for dev and
production.
- And in common application.properties define the profile
using spring.profiles.active=dev. To use spring file add
following dependency in POM file


















UseCase9-Database setting as Environment
Variable
- Open the MySQL Client and run the script in
Step1 to setup DB, User and Priviledges
- And in common application.properties define the
profile using spring.profiles.active=dev. To use
spring file add following dependency in POM file


















UseCase10-Add Validation to Name Field so
the REST call can be validated
- To begin with make it a required field i.e. a not
empty field
- Then add pattern to it.
- The Validation needs to be done for both Create
and Update REST Calls








UseCase11-Provide User Friendly Error
Response in case validation fails
- Create a Custom Exception Handlers class and use
@ControllerAdvice Annotation so that Spring
Framework can call this class to handle Exceptions
thrown during processing REST API Request.
- To handle Validation Errors create @ExceptionHandler
method for MethodArgumentNotValidException class
is defined.




















UseCase12-Ability to throw User Friendly
Errors in case Employee Id is not
found in Employee Payroll App.
- Define a Custom Exception for Employee Not
Found and through when Employee Id is passed
as parameter.
- Handle such Exceptions in @ExceptionHandler
method for EmployeePayrollException class.
